## :8ball: About

I'm a digital enthusiast from Toronto, ON. I'm dedicated to the world of front-end development and I absolutely love crafting stunning designs and effortlessly fusing them with code ‚Äì it's where the magic happens! :D

This personal website is a showcase of my finest work in front-end development, UX/UI design, and freelance endeavours during my time at college. It's been meticulously crafted with a mobile-first approach, ensuring seamless responsiveness, and it dynamically showcases all my projects.

I'm open to freelance opportunities - if you're itching to start a project, I'm just a message away!
